# RENTAL-HUB
In this era when everything is shifting on the internet and fast growing technology, our project will generate an easy opportunity for the people who are willing to rent-in or rent-out their household items but are hesitant due to non-availability of a proper yet simple platform. Our project will provide such platform. This project will enable a person to rent out their things without visiting or placing their items on some warehouse or shop. On the other hand, a person in need of something for a short term can easily rent in that thing using our system. In this way our system will provide an opportunity for the owner to earn some money and on the other hand it will save the money of the person renting in the items. Moreover, a person having some warehouse or shop providing items on rent, can use this project to expand and shift their business in another dimension of internet and technology.   In an under developed country like Pakistan where 24% of the population lies below the poverty line, this project have an ample scope. Because, people are looking for the ways to save their resources and also to generate revenue.  Being the developers of this project, our idea is to launch this application with currently specified and limited scope. But with the passage of time and as per interests and demands of people we will expand our project in all possible directions.
